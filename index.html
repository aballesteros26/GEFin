  <div class="makeMeStack" style="flex-grow: 1">Whats are Drums</div>
  <div class="makeMeStack" style="flex-grow: 1"><p>Drums are percussion instruments that produce sound when struck with sticks, mallets, or hands. They typically consist of a hollow shell covered by a drumhead or membrane, which vibrates to create sound. Drums come in various sizes, shapes, and materials, each offering a distinct tone or pitch. They are a fundamental part of music across cultures and genres, providing rhythm, tempo, and emotional intensity. From traditional hand-played congas to modern drum kits used in rock, jazz, and pop music, drums are essential for creating the pulse that drives musical expression.</p>
