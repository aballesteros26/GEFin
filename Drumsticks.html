  <div class="makeMeStack" style="flex-grow: 1">Drumsticks are percussion tools used to strike drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments to produce sound. Typically made from wood (like hickory, maple, or oak), but sometimes metal or plastic, drumsticks have a long, tapered shape with a handle on one end and a tip (or bead) on the other. The tip can be round, oval, or acorn-shaped, each offering a different tone. Drumsticks vary in size, weight, and thickness, allowing drummers to choose sticks that match their playing style, music genre, and personal preference. They are essential for controlling volume, speed, and articulation in drumming.</div>
